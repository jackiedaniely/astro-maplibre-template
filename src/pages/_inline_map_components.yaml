        - str: "Firstly, it is important to understand the region of Artsakh and it's bordering nations. Throughout history, Artsakh has been a vulnerable area of deliberate attack and destruction, mainly through the hands of Azerbaijan and hidden through the guise of war. These borders represent the changes that have occurred from 2020 – 2024. Artsakh was once part of Armenia, until declaring independence in 1991. From then on there have been countless attacks from Azerbaijan over the region. Following Azerbaijan’s continuous attacks, and following the Second Nagorno-Karabakh 'War' in 2020, the land of Artsakh is now under complete colonization, displacing the community."
